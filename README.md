Calendar Hours adds the elapsed time to Google Calendar event titles. A 10:15am–1:25pm event can become **Work session (3.17 hours)**. It works in Chrome and Microsoft Edge.

## Features

- Add a duration with a title suggestion, `/hours`, a keyboard shortcut, or the extension popup.
- Display hours or minutes, with custom rounding, increments, units, and title templates. Short events can switch to minutes automatically.
- Match phrases such as `Work block` and enable **Dynamic** separately for each phrase. Titles with an existing duration can also update after time changes.
- Connect Google Calendar for fast title saves when moving or resizing a one-time event. The first-install welcome page offers this connection; the regular Calendar editor method remains available without it.

## Getting Started

To try the current source build, load [`extension/`](extension/) as an unpacked extension in Chrome or Edge. Refresh any open Google Calendar tabs after reloading the extension. [Store publication details](STORE_LISTING.md) are tracked separately.

Open a timed event, enter its start and end times, then type `/hours` in the title or press **Tab** to accept the suggested duration. Save the event in Calendar. Settings let you customize the format and matching phrases.

Google Calendar API sign-in is currently limited to the project's OAuth test users. Broader distribution requires Google's OAuth review.

## Development

```bash
npm ci
npm test
npm run package
```

CI runs the tests and checks the package on pushes and pull requests. The package script writes a versioned ZIP under `dist/` with `manifest.json` at its root.
